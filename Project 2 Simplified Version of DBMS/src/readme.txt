Section 1:

To compile and execute this code you need to run it from eclipse (or your ide of choice) and write on the command bar whichever 
commands you wish to test (preferably "create index on randomv" as the first one).

Section 2:

All parts of my code are working as intended.

Section 3:

For the design of this project I created three classes: one for the hashtable which stored and created the hashtable, one for the array which stored
initialized and populated the array, and a reader class which openned the datasets and printed the desired records. For the different commands I used 
a switch statement, and I added an extra command "e" to exit the program.
